                    An upper endoscopy, also referred to as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 
                    or EGD, is a painless examination of the esophagus, stomach and the 
                    first portion of the small intestine or the duodenum. This is done 
                    with an endoscope, a thin, flexible tube with a camera at the end. 
                    Tissue samples, referred to as biopsies, may be taken during the procedure 
                    to check for inflammation, changes in the lining of the esophagus, 
                    stomach and duodenum, and to determine the presence of the bacteria, 
                    Helicobacter pylori, which can cause gastric cancer.

                    Capsule endoscopy is an outpatient procedure that involves visualization 
                    of the small intestine with the use of a wireless capsule equipped with a 
                    tiny camera that takes thousands of pictures for later evaluation by the 
                    gastroenterologist. The procedure, which typically takes approximately 8 hours,
                    is able to detect abnormalities in the small bowel that the conventional 
                    endoscope and colonoscope is unable to reach.
