                Smartpill is a wireless motility capsule that measures the pH, temperature 
                and pressure throughout the digestive tract. It allows the gastroenterologist 
                to determine the time it takes to travel from the mouth to the stomach, the small 
                intestine and the colon. This test is generally safe, painless and radiation-free.

                The smartpill is able to determine the gastric emptying time, small bowel transit 
                time and the colonic transit time of the patient. It can help the phsysician 
                diagnose gastroparesis, a condition where the muscles of the stomach is not able 
                to function properly, delayed small bowel transit, and slow transit constipation.
                It may be indicated for patients who have symptoms of indigestion, 
                prolonged sensation of fullness, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, bloating and chronic constipation.
                The procedure involves swallowing a capsule with the help of water after 
                consuming a standardized granola bar. As the capsule travels throughout the 
                digestive tract, it wirelessly transmits data to the receiver which is worn on a 
                lanyard or a belt clip. The test can take up to five days long but usually lasts 
                only 1-3 days.
