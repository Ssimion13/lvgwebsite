                The H. pylori breath test is a quick and simple office-based test that determines the 
                presence of active Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a 
                bacteria that can cause ulcers in the stomach and the duodenum or the first part of the 
                small intestine. This test is typically ordered for patients who have 
                complaints of abdominal pain, dyspepsia, esophageal reflux and heartburn. It is also 
                indicated for patients who have been found to have the presence of ulcers in the stomach 
                and duodenum. It can also be used to determine the effectivity of antibiotic therapy for 
                patients who have recently been treated for known H. pylori infection.

                This test involves the patient blowing into a small bag that traps and stores the 
                patientâ€™s breath. He/she then drinks a small solution containing urea. After ten to 
                fifteen minutes, the patient finally blows into another small bag. The two breath samples 
                are tested for differences in carbon dioxide content. If the patient is found to have a 
                positive test, he or she can be treated for the bacterial infection.
