            Dr. Fajardo and Dr. Cremonini have both undergone specialized training in GI Motility and 
            Neurogastroenterology Disorders.  Las Vegas Gastroenterology provides state-of-the-art technology
            that has the ability to perform certain specialized diagnostic procedures for gastrointestinal 
            motility disorders. These procedures help doctors obtain further understanding of your diagnosis
            so you can begin your appropriate treatment.

            Our clinic provides motility studies for patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Motility
            studies evaluate how the esophagus, stomach, small bowel and colon functions.  These procedures 
            are usually painless and provide important data about the digestive system.

            <h2> Among the studies we offer include: </h2>
            <h2> Smartpill </h2>
            <p className="serviceDescriptionText">

                Smartpill is a wireless motility capsule that measures the pH, 
                temperature and pressure throughout the digestive tract. 
                It allows the gastroenterologist to determine the time it takes to travel 
                from the mouth to the stomach, the small intestine and the colon. This test is generally safe,
                painless and radiation-free.

            <h2> Esophageal Manometry </h2>
            <p className="serviceDescriptionText">

                Esophageal manometry is a motility test that evaluates the movements,
                strength and coordination of the esophagus, also referred to as the food pipe.
                This test measures the progression of food and liquids down the esophagus. 
                It can also measure the strength of the patient’s lower esophageal sphincter (LES),
                the involuntary muscles that form a valve-like structure at the lower end of the
                esophagus where it meets the stomach. The LES prevents food, liquid and acid 
                produced in the stomach from backing up into the esophagus.

            <h2> Esophageal pH Monitoring (24 hour) </h2>
            <p className="serviceDescriptionText">

                    Esophageal pH monitoring is a test that involves 24-hour measuring and recording of the
                    acid levels in the esophagus, also referred to as the food pipe. This test can
                    determine the frequency, duration and intensity of the acid within the esophagus.
                    It can also help determine if a patient has acidic reflux or non-acidic reflux.
                    For patients undergoing evaluation for anti-reflux surgery, the findings from the
                    test will help the gastroenterologist and surgeon determine if surgery will benefit
                    the patient. This test may also be ordered by the gastroenterologist measure 
                    the effectiveness of acid suppression medications or anti-reflux surgery on a patient.

            <h2> Hydrogen Breath Test </h2>
            <p className="serviceDescriptionText">
            
                The hydrogen breath test is an office-based test that measures the hydrogen and methane 
                levels detected in the breath of a patient. This allows the gastroenterologist to help 
                determine the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). The small bowel 
                normally does not have large amounts of bacteria, however, with some patients, bacteria 
                tend to colonize within the small bowel, causing symptoms such as bloating, flatulence, 
                abdominal pain/discomfort, diarrhea and abdominal distension.

            <h2> H. Pylori Breath Test </h2>
            <p className="serviceDescriptionText">
                
                    The H. pylori breath test is a quick and simple office-based test that determines the presence
                    of active Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacteria
                    that can cause ulcers in the stomach and the duodenum or the first part of the small intestine.
                    This test is typically ordered for patients who have complaints of abdominal pain, dyspepsia, 
                    esophageal reflux and heartburn.
